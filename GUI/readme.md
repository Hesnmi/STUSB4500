## Presentation

The STSW-STUSB002 is a free graphical interface (GUI) aimed at customizing seamlessly the STUSB devices through direct access to non-volatile-memory (NVM). <br/>

The tool allows NVM area to be read, configured and written without dedicated software skills, thanks to a graphical interface. <br/>

The utility also provides a basic panel to read and write I²C registers at any device address and any register address, as well as a device dashboard. <br/>

The software can be used with the evaluation boards from the STUSB devices stacked on a NUCLEO-F072RB controller board. The device selection is done automatically at power-up, as far as the Nucleo is flashed and configured in order to act as a USB to I²C bridge (.bin included). <br/>


## Key Features
* Access to the STUSB non-volatile-memory
* Read and write any I2C register address
* Device dashboard (to see chip status in real time)
* Operating system required: Microsoft Windows 7, 8.1, 10
